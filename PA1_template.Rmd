## Loading and preprocessing the data


```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
rawData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
total_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = rawData, sum)
hist(total_steps$steps, col = "red", main = "Histogram of total steps taken each day", xlab = "Total Steps", breaks = 50)
mean(total_steps$steps)
median(total_steps$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
dailyPattern <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = rawData, mean)
with(dailyPattern, plot(interval, steps, type = "l", ylab = "Mean steps"))
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
